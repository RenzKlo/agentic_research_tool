# LangChain Agentic AI Project

This project creates an autonomous AI agent using LangChain that can use tools to accomplish tasks.

## Code Generation Guidelines

- Use LangChain framework for agent creation and tool integration
- Follow async/await patterns for tool operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use type hints and docstrings for all functions
- Create modular, reusable tool components
- Implement safety checks for code execution tools
- Use Streamlit for modern, interactive UI components
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guide

## Key Technologies

- **LangChain**: For agent reasoning and tool orchestration
- **Streamlit**: For interactive web interface
- **Pandas**: For data analysis capabilities
- **Requests**: For web API interactions
- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping tools
- **Plotly**: For data visualizations
- **OpenAI**: For LLM integration

## Agent Architecture

The agent should be able to:
1. Reason about complex tasks
2. Break down tasks into steps
3. Select appropriate tools
4. Execute tools autonomously
5. Learn from results and adapt
6. Maintain conversation context

Generate code that creates a true autonomous agent, not just a chatbot with predefined functions.
